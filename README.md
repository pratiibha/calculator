Calculator Web Application
Overview:
This calculator project is a web-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input mathematical expressions, perform calculations, and view the calculation history.

Key Features:

User Interface:

The calculator has a clean and responsive user interface, designed for optimal viewing on various devices.
Input Display:

The input display is a text field where users can input numerical values and mathematical operators.
Basic Operations:

Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations by clicking on the respective buttons.
Additional Functions:

The calculator includes additional functionality such as clearing the display (AC button), deleting the last character (DE button), and adding decimal points (. button).
Calculation History:

The calculator keeps track of calculation history, displaying the input expression along with its result. Users can see a list of past calculations in the history section.
Error Handling:

The calculator gracefully handles errors, providing a user-friendly "Error" message in case of invalid input or calculations.
How to Use:

Input Expression:

Users can input numerical values and mathematical operators using the calculator buttons.
Perform Calculations:

Clicking the = button calculates the result of the entered expression and displays it in the input field.
History:

The history section displays a list of past calculations, including the input expression and its result.
Additional Functions:

The AC button clears the input display.
The DE button deletes the last character from the input display.
Decimal points can be added using the . button.
Development Information:

The calculator is implemented using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and logic.
The project uses event handlers to respond to user input and dynamically updates the display and history.
Note: While this calculator is functional for basic calculations, it's important to be cautious when using the eval function, especially in more complex or security-sensitive applications. Additionally, the project could be expanded with additional features, improved styling, and enhanced error handling based on specific requirements.
